# Hello World
Create a basic hello world website using HTML, CSS, & JavaScript.

## Details
The "Hello World" app, is a traditional first project when learning a new programming language or technology. This will be a very simple page, but is a good chance to learn or review the basics of connecting all of your web files together.

1. Create an index.html page using a standard HTML5 template. You should have:
  - an HTML5 doctype tag
  - a `head` element with a `meta` charset tag & `title` (Set the title to "Hello World".)
  - a `body` element
  - add an `h1` element to the `body` that also says "Hello World".
  - below the `h1` add a paragraph (`p` element) that says "Check the console for a message."

2. Add a CSS file and use a `link` element to add the CSS to your HTML page.  
  - Add basic styles to make the page look good.
  - You can do as little or as much as you want here.

3. Add a JavaScript file and use a `script` element to add the JS file to your HTML page. In the JS file:
  - define a function that will write the message "Hello from JavaScript!" to the console.
  - call the function you defined above

4. Test
  - Open your page in the browser.  
  - You should see your styles reflected on the web page. If not, check your `link` tag.
  - You should see your message in the console.  If not, check your `script` tag.
